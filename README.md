Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. 

## Gender, Politics & Twitter

- As part of my master's program at UVA, we created a pipeline to capture Tweets about the 2020 democratic primary, and then analyzed whether there were differences in how Twitter talked about  male vs. female candidates. 
- As part of the project, I created an interactive visual in D3 that shows the relative word usages when Twitter discussed male and female candidates. You can find the visual [here](https://jbtiez.github.io/Demos.io/).
