Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!  

## Gender, Politics & Twitter

- As part of my master's program at UVA, we created a pipeline to capture Tweets about the 2020 democratic primary, and then analyzed whether there were differences in how Twitter talked about  male vs. female candidates. 
- Among the methods we utilized were basic word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis using [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment), and word embeddings (w/ Word2Vec). This project culiminated in a published academic paper ([click here for abstract](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9106584))
- As part of the project, I created an interactive visual in D3 that shows the relative word usages when Twitter discussed male and female candidates. You can find the visual [here](https://jbtiez.github.io/Demos.io/). (Note: Visual works best in Chrome or Edge; there are minor formatting issues in Firefox)
